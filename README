Clone an svn repo with externals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

git-svn-clone-externals.py svn-working-copy dest-dir

The main difference between this and other alternative scripts is that this
starts from an svn checkout to discover the externals.

TODO:
* git-ignore externals
* test on convoluted externals (relative paths)
* manage fixed revision externals
