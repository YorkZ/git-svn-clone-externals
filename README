Clone an svn repo with externals
================================

Usage
-----

`git-svn-clone-externals.py svn-working-copy dest-dir`

The main difference between this and other alternative scripts is that this
one starts from an svn checkout to discover the externals.

Depends
-------

`sudo apt-get install git-svn`


TODO
----

[ ] git-ignore externals
[ ] test on convoluted externals (relative paths)
[ ] manage fixed revision externals
